		<p>Vicki has been involved in music since age 7, starting with piano lessons. She started playing clarinet in 6th grade. In high school, she switched to oboe for concert season and flute for marching band, which she continued playing through college. Vicki attended UGA, and has a Bachelors of Music in Music Therapy, with a primary emphasis on oboe. She earned a Masters in Education for Severe Emotional and Behavioral Disorders, and pursued a job in that field, where she stayed for her entire career in DeKalb County Schools. Vicki switched from oboe to bassoon in 2004, staying in the double reed family. She has been playing bassoon in community groups since that time. In addition to Tara Winds, Vicki currently plays with the Atlanta Wind Symphony, Callanwolde Concert Band, and fills in with Georgia Philharmonic whenever possible. Upon her retirement in 2008, Vicki pursued her interest in photography, and is a member of several photography groups. She takes frequent trips to photograph wildlife, flowers, and landscapes. Vicki and her husband, Mike, were married in August 1976. Their family includes their daughter, Jessica and son-in-law, John Mark, who live in San Francisco, California.</p>
		<p>As part of her interest in photography, Vicki created the slideshow for Heartland Sketches by Mark Camphouse for Tara Winds' Scholarship Concert in May 2017. Vicki requested images of rural and agricultural scenes from heartland of America from members of Georgia Nature Photographers Association (GNPA), a state-wide photography group of which she is a member.  Thirteen photographers submitted over 120 images, which were used to create the slideshow on ProShow Web. Many thanks to the following photographers who submitted images for the Heartland Sketches project: Jerry Black, Sue Copley, Mary Jo Cox, Steve Crouch, Joyce Glover, Janet Newton, Ray Silva, Vicki Smith, Judy Wagner, Stephen Weiss, Steve White, Connie White, and Diane Yancey. </p>
